# SpaceShooter :: Mankind Invation 

## Background Idea
This project pays tribute to all existing "Spaceshooters" and "Side Scrollers" where humanity must defend itself against the superior power of evil aliens. I always wonder why all these aliens are so evil?
It is also conceivable that humans are the evil aggressors. 
And we have enough bad guys here on earth.

### Quotes of Victims
Out of the depths of space appears a dangerous scourge. A pandemic that wants to own everything in the galaxy. 
This scourge calls itself humanity and has no regrets for other life forms. 
Their economic system makes them greedy and hungry for raw materials, because they never stop wanting to make profit. 
Therefore, they impose war on the free worlds of the universe.
(Survivor of an attack by humans on a space station near "Sol", Gra. Sylgiert of Asalahan, Gawaloriaian)

I saw in my visions so dark and so deep mankind will destruct all life. (Synviir Valkaran Stompp)
